- Refactor the tests to only have 2 servers (one already configured, another empty)
    - Move "no fly database" to single_user_spec.rb
    - Rename config_spec.rb to cli_spec.rb
    - Move "allow unauthenticated ping/quit" to conn_spec.rb
    - In before :suite, automatically create a properly configured server.
      Then create one authenticated connection, and one unauthenticated connection
- Continue working on more commands (file, ACLs)
- File streaming (prioritize command requests & responses!)
- To get the server out of single-user mode, we should use AUTH instead of ADDUSER, would make things less confusing
- Verify integrity of the databases when reading from them
- Each command should have a unit test to make sure it calls checkAuth, and to make sure it returns -DENIED when checkAuth returned false (use bytes.Buffer?)
- Handle invalid inputs in the protocol
- Allow for a custom config path (instead of .fly)
- Should allow you to pass a single file instead of a dir (for quickly sharing a file)
