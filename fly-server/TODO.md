- Continue working on more commands
    - GETOPT/SETOP => chunk size negotiation
    - CHROOT
    - DEL
    - AUTH TOK / TOKEN
    - LIST
    - MOVE

    - SYNC
- Refactor commands & specs to have one file per command
- Ruby tests shouldn't test things with the local disk. Should just use the protocol itself
- Verify integrity of the databases when reading from them
- Allow for a custom config path (instead of .fly)
- Should allow you to pass a single file instead of a dir (for quickly sharing a file)
