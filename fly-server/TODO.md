- To test for command case sensitivity: second time cmd() is called on a command,
  mix up the case. Then, in after(:suite), make sure all commands
  were called with mixed casing!
- Perhaps change >X to @X, call them tags? And make wire unaware of command frames, streams and such?. Wire shouldn't do any validation of the command array.
- Put commands in a separate package
- Race condition with the CLOSE tests sometimes?
- .fly folder should be hidden from commands!! (vfs should take care of this. write test)
- Continue working on more commands
    - SETPWD
    - SETADM
    - GETOPT/SETOP => chunk size negotiation
    - CHROOT
    - DEL
    - AUTH TOK / TOKEN
    - LIST
    - MOVE
    - COPY => could be slow operation if recursive
    - TOUCH
    - SYNC
    - LISTACP
    - ADDACP
    - MODACP
    - RMACP
- Ruby tests shouldn't test things with the local disk. Should just use the protocol itself
- To get the server out of single-user mode, we should use AUTH instead of ADDUSER, would make things less confusing
- Verify integrity of the databases when reading from them
- Each command should have a unit test to make sure it calls checkAuth, and to make sure it returns -DENIED when checkAuth returned false (use bytes.Buffer?)
- Allow for a custom config path (instead of .fly)
- Should allow you to pass a single file instead of a dir (for quickly sharing a file)
