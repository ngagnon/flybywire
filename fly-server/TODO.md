- Each command should have a unit test to make sure it calls checkAuth, and to make sure it returns -DENIED when checkAuth returned false (use bytes.Buffer?)
- Refactor protocol serialization stuff into resp.go
- We should accept simple strings and nulls when reading command arguments
- Handle invalid inputs in the protocol
- Allow for a custom config path (instead of .fly)
- Should allow you to pass a single file instead of a dir (for quickly sharing a file)
