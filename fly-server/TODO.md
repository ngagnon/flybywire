- Add regularUser, singleUser personas to spec_helper
- Continue working on more commands
    - SETPWD
    - SETADM
    - GETOPT/SETOP => chunk size negotiation
    - CHROOT
    - DEL
    - AUTH TOK / TOKEN
    - LIST
    - MOVE
    - COPY => could be slow operation if recursive
    - TOUCH
    - LISTACP
    - ADDACP
    - MODACP
    - RMACP
    - SYNC
- Ruby tests shouldn't test things with the local disk. Should just use the protocol itself
- To get the server out of single-user mode, we should use AUTH instead of ADDUSER, would make things less confusing
- Verify integrity of the databases when reading from them
- Each command should have a unit test to make sure it calls checkAuth, and to make sure it returns -DENIED when checkAuth returned false (use bytes.Buffer?)
- Allow for a custom config path (instead of .fly)
- Should allow you to pass a single file instead of a dir (for quickly sharing a file)
